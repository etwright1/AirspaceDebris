The aircraft transponder data is too large to upload here but is available from https://samples.adsbexchange.com/readsb-hist/. We downloaded it in 5 second intervals. The 'Output data' folder is also too large to upload but will be generated by the below scripts.

The file 'create_weighting_function'.py uses the past 10 years of reentry data from GCAT to build a weighting function as described in the paper methodology.

The file 'find_aircraft_expectation.py' uses data from 1 September 2023 to find the casualty expectation for that day. 

The file 'find_airspace_expectation.py' uses data from 1 September 2023 to find the airspace infringement expectation for that day. 

The four plotting scripts create each plot used in the paper.
